Yet another hello-world repository.

I am a full time student at Southern New Hampshire University and pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics.  I live in northern VT with my wife and 3 working-line German Shepherds.  I enjoy the arts, reading, gaming, traveling, and learning all things tech.  I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and when I can, I indulge in my creative side in making some (usually) abstract art.
